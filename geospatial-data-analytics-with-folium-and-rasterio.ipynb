Applying all code on Uganda, Africa, by using WorldPop data.\n\nAuthors:  Johnny Lau, and Albert Um\n\nPrerequisites\n❌ Limited knowledge in geographic information system;\n\n✔️ Some Python programming and visualization skills\n\nWe didn’t have much prior experience working with remote sensing and geospatial data visualization. Still, we managed to make it happen, thanks to this collaborative project with Omdena on evaluating Africa’s infrastructure development needs!\n\nThe Project\nEfficient and effective infrastructure is critical to economic transformation. Over time, Africa’s infrastructure investment needs have increased, with an estimated financing gap amounting up to $108 billion every year (Ref 1).\n\nIn response to the call by an Omdena challenge partnering with African Center for Economic Transformation (ACET), we joined a global community of data scientists, engineers, and enthusiasts. We collaborated on a project over a period of two months to evaluate and predict the infrastructure needs of various African countries using data science and the latest technology. The project aimed to support ACET’s ongoing work on infrastructure development.\n\nLeft: Photo by Captureson Photography on Unsplash; Right Photo by Charles Nambasi on Pixabay\nLeft: Photo by Captureson Photography on Unsplash; Right Photo by Charles Nambasi on Pixabay\n\nAs part of the project, we were tasked with retrieving population information of African nations. In particular, we needed some spatially disaggregated estimates at subnational, local levels. We were also interested in the comparison of annual population growth.\n\nThe Challenges in Population Estimation\nPopulation analysis is regarded as extremely important in regional and urban planning. The main sources for such demographic data are the national census, typically conducted once every 10 years, along with national registers of births and deaths. However, survey-driven censuses are expensive to implement, are infrequently performed, and only provide population counts over broad areas. Moreover, in resource-poor settings, national registers are generally lacking or incomplete. These problems could be worse for some African countries. For example, the Democratic Republic of the Congo hasn’t had a census since 1984 (Ref 2).\n\nFortunately, recent advances in computing power, availability of regularly updated high-resolution satellite imagery, global positioning systems (GPS)-enabled field survey techniques, and statistical learning methods have given rise to opportunities for alternative approaches to producing reliable, spatially refined estimates of human populations.\n\nData collection and preparation\nWorldPop’s open-source gridded population data [footnote 1] is a good example of the application of these methods and techniques. It combines data from neighborhood-scale microcensus surveys (population counts undertaken in small areas) with information from national-scale satellite imagery and digital mapping. In short, WorldPop leveraged machine learning modeling (random forest) to extrapolate high-resolution national population estimates from the relatively sparse microcensus data (including predicting populations in unsurveyed locations). In the Omdena project, we used Worldpop imagery data to help with our tasks in population estimation. Also, for the blog here, we are demonstrating (with modified code) how we visualized population distribution using this dataset.\n\n¬¬Some features of WorldPop data (and why we used it in our project?)\n\nDatasets cover almost all countries on the African continent\nThe gridded population data (i.e., raster images) are available at a spatial resolution as detailed as 3 arc seconds (approximately 100m at the equator)\nThese high-resolution maps are available yearly from 2000–2020 \nThey are provided in the format (.tif) that can be easily analyzed and handled with commonly used programming and analytics software\nAggregating WorldPop Counts for Uganda\nLet’s code along!\n\nThere are three main parts in the workflow to compute subregional estimates and visualize population distribution using the raster data. I use Jupyter notebook to perform this coding part.\n\n1. Downloading and loading the gridded population images\nThere are a few ways to download the Worldpop data (.tif images) using some plugins outlined on their website. Here, we use wget and its .download() function to download the data directly from their FTP server.\n\nTo load and read the data, we use the rasterio module.\n\nEstimating population in African countries using geospatial data - Source: Omdena\nEstimating population in African countries using geospatial data – Source: Omdena\n\nYou can download, read and plot this image above using the following code:\n\n# Import required packages\n# --------------------\nimport wget\nimport rasterio\nfrom rasterio import mask\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport folium\n\n\n# Download raster/tif file (download gridded population data from WorldPop)\n# --------------------\nFILE_DIR = \"data/worldpop\"\n# d/l yr 2020 data\nurl2020 = \"ftp://ftp.worldpop.org.uk/GIS/Population/Global_2000_2020/2020/UGA/uga_ppp_2020.tif\"   \nwget.download(url2020, FILE_DIR)\n\n# also d/l yr 2019 data\nurl2019 = \"ftp://ftp.worldpop.org.uk/GIS/Population/Global_2000_2020/2019/UGA/uga_ppp_2019.tif\"   \nwget.download(url2019, FILE_DIR)\n\n\n# Read raster/tif file\n# --------------------\nuga_tif = 'data/worldpop/uga_ppp_2020.tif'\nraster_uga = rasterio.open(uga_tif)\npop_uga_data = raster_uga.read(1)\n\n# A crude way to count the population size represented in the image\npop_uga_count = pop_uga_data[pop_uga_data > 0].sum()\n\n\n## Plot raster/tif image\n# --------------------\ndef plot_raster(rast_data, title='', figsize=(10,10)):\n  \"\"\"\n  Plots population count in log scale(+1)\n  \"\"\"\n  plt.figure(figsize = figsize)\n  im1 = plt.imshow(np.log1p(rast_data),) # vmin=0, vmax=2.1)\n\n  plt.title(\"{}\".format(title), fontdict = {'fontsize': 20})  \n  plt.axis('off')\n  plt.colorbar(im1, fraction=0.03)\n\n\n  \ntitle = 'Population Distribution (2020) in Uganda (Log Scaled) n Est count: {}'.format(uga_pop_count)\nplot_raster(pop_uga_data, title)\nTo work out the estimated total number of people of the country, we can sum up the estimates represented by each value per grid cell (with this line specifically).\n\n# A crude way to aggregate the population size represented in the image\n\npop_uga_count = pop_uga_data[pop_uga_data > 0].sum()\n2. Aggregating regional estimates at district levels\nTo extract the estimated count for a district, we need to know the information about the boundary of the district. A shapefile — a geospatial data format — stores this information (i.e. the digital boundaries of areas/features at a defined level). Here, we use the shapefile map for Uganda from the GADM website.\n\nLet’s load and plot the shapefile (at administrative level 2).\n\n# the shape files for Uganda were downloaded here:\n\n# https://gadm.org/\n\nuga_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame.from_file(\"data/shpfiles/UGA/gadm36_UGA_2.shp\")\n\n\n# plot the shapefile\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 5,5\nuga_gdf.plot(color=\"white\", edgecolor=\"#2e3131\")\nplt.title('Uganda: level 2 regions')\nEstimating population in African countries using geospatial data - Source: Omdena\nEstimating population in African countries using geospatial data – Source: Omdena\n\nuga_gdf.head(3) #check the first few rows of the shapefile dataframe\n\n\nThis is what the geo-data frame (shapefile data) looks like, though we are only interested in getting the district names (‘NAME_1’) and ‘geometry’ from this dataset. (‘geometry’ contains the geospatial points of the polygon that defines the boundary of the district)\n\nAs a side note, spatial data may be formatted in different Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs). A CRS defines how a two-dimensional, projected map relates to the real places on the earth. We can check the CRS as well as other metadata stored in the shapefile.\n\nuga_gdf.crs   #to see the CRS format of the file\nEstimating population in African countries using geospatial data - Source: Omdena\nEstimating population in African countries using geospatial data – Source: Omdena\n\nWe can apply the shapefile with the raster image to extract the estimated number of people of a district, for example, Apac, in Uganda (using rasterio’s mask.mask function).\n\n# using mask.mask function from Rasterio to define the region of interest\ngtraster, bound = mask.mask(raster_uga, uga_gdf[uga_gdf.GID_1 == “Apac”].geometry, crop=True)\n\ngtraster[0][gtraster[0]>0].sum()\nNow, putting everything together, we produce the local-scale population estimates of all the districts defined in the shapefile, for 2019 and 2020. On top of that, we compute the percentage change in population sizes over the year (follow the code below).\n\n# the shapefiles for Uganda were downloaded here: \n# https://gadm.org/\n\n# Load in the shapefile\n# --------------------\nuga_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame.from_file(\"data/shpfiles/UGA/gadm36_UGA_2.shp\") \n\n\n# Estimate the population size per defined district for each year (from the .tif image available for each year)\n# --------------------\nfor year in range(2019, 2021):\n    # Read raster/tif file\n    raster_uga = 'data/worldpop/UGA/uga_ppp_{}.tif'.format(year) \n    pop_raster_uga = rasterio.open(raster_uga)   \n    pop_uga_data = pop_raster_uga.read(1)\n    \n    # loop through each defined district contained in the shapefile and use it as the mask to extract values\n    _results = []\n    for i in uga_gdf['GID_1']:\n        roi = uga_gdf[uga_gdf.GID_1 == i]\n\n        # using the mask.mask module from Rasterio to specify the ROI\n        gtraster, bound = mask.mask(pop_raster_uga, roi[\"geometry\"], crop=True) \n        \n        # values greater than 0 represent the estimated population count for that pixel\n        _results.append(gtraster[0][gtraster[0]>0].sum())\n     \n    # save the estimated counts for each year in a new column\n    uga_gdf[str(year)] = _results\n    \n \n# also, compute the percentage change in estimated counts across years\nuga_gdf['growth_rate'] = uga_gdf[['2019', '2020']].pct_change(axis=1)['2020']*100\nThis is the final data frame.\n\n\nHaving extracted the estimated population sizes and then computed the percentage change (growth rate) by district levels, we can visualize them on a map for easier comparison using choropleth graphs.\n\n3. Creating interactive choropleth maps with mask.maskFolium\nBefore making the choropleth layer, we need a folium base map, and it is important to let the map know where it should be centered (i.e., specifying the centroid coordinates to the map). We can assign the centroid by taking the mean of the coordinates of all the polygons.\n\nOnce we have the centroid, we create the map object and choose a background tile. By default, ‘Open Street Map’ is chosen, and this is also the one we use.\n\nAt this point, the stage has been set. We are ready to create and overlay the choropleth plot to the map by passing the following parameters into the choropleth function.\n\n.geo_data: geopandas data frame holding information of geographic geometry\n.data: data frame containing values to be used for plotting the choropleth maps\n.columns: the names of two columns — first column to be used as the key (‘NAME_1′ containing the names of the district in our case); second column are the values to be mapped (‘growth_rate’)\n.key_on: Variable in geo_data to bind the data to.
